I like using ERA5 data for running WRF, but it is a real pain to download the ERA 5 data from the Climate Data Store. There is always a long queue. 
Even I openned 64 threads to download data at the same time, it is still extremely slow. How slow. It took about 2 hours to download one single varialbe at one single pressure 
of one single hour. 
Fortunately, NCEP RDA has already downloaded the full dataset which can be transfered to the supercomputer I use via Globus easily. The bad news is that each data file contains
global fields which makes storing and then preprocessing the data using WRF-WPS very slow (how slow? slower than what I can tolerate. But I realized more and more that 
the seemingly slowest turns out to be the fastest more often than not). 

Well, what should I do? Two ways: 
1. transfer all the data in grib format and then preprocess them using WRF-WPS. 
    No. preprocessing takes too long. 
2. subset all the data in netcdf format and then transfer the subsetted data. 
    Well. The pains started here. 
    First, we can precipitates the subsetting process by using ncks (note, for the same subsetting cdo is much slower than nco) and by parrallelizing it.
